# Github Pages Projects

One of the affordances of Github Pages is that it can host static HTML webpages. Here are a couple different ways to quickly get a website up and running.

## Fork a website
Seriously. That's it. Fork another website. So let's fork this one called [Clean Blog](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll).

## Jekyll
This template uses a CMS called Jekyll, which generates static HTML pages. This means that to blog we won't have to write actual HTML, instead we will write in a Github flavor of Markdown. If necessary, feel free to use this [Markdown Cheatset](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet).

## Is this thing already live?!
Yes! To find your web address, click on Settings.
