# Group 1 - Collaborative Design

## Suggested Approach

Github can be utilized for collaborative course design for both an instructional design group working together on a course design as well as a way instructors who teach multiple sections of a course to create modified versions of a single syllabus.

## Instructional Design Approach
For this workshop, we've supplied you with a standard syllabus (syllabus.md). As a group, decide what institution you would like to be (i.e. University of Disruption) and what course for which you would like to build a syllabus (i.e. "The History of Education Technology Since 2011") and other relevant information (instructor: Cassius Clay Christian and Sons)

1. Click the [syllabus.md](https://github.com/oudiglearn/olcinnovate-github/blob/master/Group%201%20-%20Collaborative%20Design/SYLLABUS.md) link.
2. Click "Edit this file"
3. Begin making edits to the syllabus.md file.
