## CURATORIAL STATEMENT 

“Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications. Ours is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live.”
-John Perry Barlow, 1996, “A Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace”
KDH: WHILE AFIXING A EPIGRAPH IS STANDARD IN ACADEMIC WRITING, INSTEAD, WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE ENGAGEMENT WITH THE KEYWORD RIGHT FROM THE START. CAN YOU INSTEAD INCORPORATE THIS QUOTE INTO YOUR DEFINITION? 

 
At its most basic, the term “gender,” based on the mid 20th century work of psychologist John Money, describes the social and enacted sex role, as opposed to biological sex roles as assigned at birth (Halberstam). <—CAN YOU INCORPORATE HALBERSTAM INTO THIS DISCUSSION; HE’S SUCH A STRONG FOCUS FOR THIS CONVERSATION, YOU DO WELL TO OPEN WITH SOMETHING FROM HIS WORK, BUT REMEMBER THAT SOME OF THE USERS OF THIS COLLECTION MAY BE NEW TO THE DEBATES AROUND GENDER AND/OR THE TEACHING OF IT, IN ADDITION TO BEING NEW TO DIGITAL PEDAGOGY 

The Oxford English Dictionary traces the etymology of the word to the 12th century Middle French and Anglo-Norman gendre, meaning “kind, sort,” but also “sex, quality of being male or female,” among other things (“Gender”). <—THIS IS IMPORTANT, BUT I THINK THERE’S ROOM TO IMMEDIATELY CHALLENGE THIS DEFINITION (IN THE SAME SENTENCE) RATHER THAN OFFERING IT AS INFORMATION 
Money’s use of the term, naturally emphasizes difference, but recognizes the constructed and reinforced nature of that difference. Since then, this conception of gender has been problematized, critiqued, and developed to move beyond gender binaries and include discussions of performativity, racialization, labor, capital, and power. KDH: CAN YOU ADD THE SCHOLARS? IT WILL BE HELPFUL FOR THOSE WHO ARE STARTING FRESH WITH GENDER

In the 1990s, the early days of the Internet, many dreamed that we <—KDH: CAN YOU EXCISE USE OF PLURAL FIRST PERSON? IT’S NOT NECESSARY IN THIS INSTANCE 
might be able to do away with gender, at least in virtual space. People like John Parry Barlow argued that the new networked communication technologies would allow us <—HERE TOO to interact without our <—HERE TOO physical bodies or real-world identities getting in the way. <—SAY MORE HERE; THE ESSENTIALISM OF GENDER IS WHAT I THINK YOU’RE ABOUT TO DEBATE OR REHEARSE HERE. We’d <—KDH: HERE TOO WITH FIRST PERSON finally be able to get away from our messy, gendered, racialized, fleshy bodies. These digital utopianists have since been proven wrong by the work of scholars of media, writers such as Anne Balsamo, Wendy Chun, Julian Dibbell, Anna Everett, Tara McPherson, Lisa Nakamura, and Sherry Turkle. <—CAN YOU SAY WHY BRIEFLY HERE BEFORE MOVING INTO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH IN RELATIONSHIP TO THESE SCHOLARS? 

From the TinySex that took place in text-based MUDs and MOOs of the 1990s, to the gendered violence of GamerGate, to the harassment experienced by feminists online (or even any person presenting as female or queer in online spaces), gender has emerged as perhaps the single most important factor in inspiring violence or support and kinship in online spaces. <—DO YOU WANT TO SAY MORE HERE? THERE’S BEEN A LOT LATELY (LAST YEAR?); I’M THINKING OF JACQUE WERNIMONT’S WORK, TOO, IF IT’S APPROPRIATE TO MENTION For many, it is the indicator of how we <—KDH: LET’S ELIMINATE THE FIRST PERSON can participate in the civic engagement, how we are treated within the public sphere, and the rights that we are afforded. <—WHO IS THE “WE” HERE? As part of the “race, gender, sexuality, and class” formula used to categorize populations, and predict or explain their behaviors, gender has proven to be one of the most critical factors in determining our identities, whether virtual or “real.” <—KDH: THIS SENTENCE REPEATS PREVIOUS BUT NOT SURE ABOUT IT’S PURPOSE

For those of us <—I’M NOT SURE HOW IMPORTANT YOU WANT THIS IDENTIFICATION TO BE; REMEMBER, NEW USERS OF DIGITAL PEDAGOGY MAY FEEL LEFT OUT who teach in both physical classrooms and digital spaces, gender is of paramount importance to that teaching. <—WHY? IS THIS TO TEACH ABOUT ONLINE ADVOCACY, AND DOES IT CARRY-OVER INTO IRL? This refers to both gender and and gendered practice, as these dictate the politics of the classroom community, and power dynamics of the people in the class. It informs what we teach and how we teach with those whom we teach. None of these are neutral.<—SO, THIS SEEMS TO BE THE MOST INTEGRAL STATEMENT RELATING TO PEDAGOGY IN YOUR CURATORIAL STATEMENT; YOU MIGHT CONSIDER LIMITING THE OPENING REMARKS AND GET TO THE PEDAGOGY MUCH MORE QUICKLY. (IN 750 WORDS, IT’S ALREADY DIFFICULT TO ASSESS THE ENTIRE FIELD OF GENDER STUDIES. IT’S OKAY NOT TO COVER IT ALL. INSTEAD, THINK ABOUT WHAT WOULD BE MOST IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT BEFORE TURNING TO PEDAGOGY?) 

As Alexis Lothian notes in her curatorial statement of the keyword Sexuality, “Classes in gender and sexuality bring together students for whom the recognition of hard-won identities feels like a matter of life and death, along with those who think that their normative gender and heterosexual identifications mean that a class on sexuality will teach them much about others and little about themselves.” Such a process, though, as Lothian points out, and anyone who has taught gender and sexuality studies can attest, is a difficult and fraught one, and few people ever feel “safe” in such spaces, no matter how hard we as instructors may work to provide such a space. <-SO YOU TURN TO SAFETY AGAIN, HERE Gender is important as a marker of difference, but also of affinity. <—NOT SURE WHAT YOU MEAN HERE In my own classes, whether I am teaching Asian American literature, or digital labor, I purposefully weave gender studies analysis into the study of history, literature, canon formation, or broader interdisciplinary humanities topics. <—BUT HOW DO YOU DO THIS? REMEMBER THE NEWBIE This gives students a more nuanced understanding of specific contexts, of situated knowledge that comes from different experiences, informed by disparate subject positions. At the same time, I ask students to be conscious of their own identities, privileges, expectations, and to question where these come from. <—TO WHAT EFFECT? IT’S OK TO USE FIRST PERSON HERE, BUT GIVE US MORE DETAILS, IF YOU CAN

More broadly, a digital pedagogy attuned to gender must be reflexive of our own genders, our gendered practice, the genders of our students, and the gendering that happens in the classroom. <—AH YES! SO USING DIGITAL PEDAGOGY REGARDING THIS KEYWORD IS FRAUGHT WITH ALL KINDS OF DOUBLED EXPECTATIONS, EXCEPTIONS, IMPERATIVES FOR ALL PARTIES INVOLVED. Central to this reflexivity is a sensitivity to the experiential knowledge of each person in the room. Such a pedagogy should also aspire to be a feminist pedagogy, <—WHY? WHAT IF A PRACTITIONER DOESN’T WANT TO TAKE THIS BIG STEP BUT WANTS TO TEST THE WATERS WITH 1 ASSIGNMENT AT FIRST? CAN YOU THINK ALONG THE LINES OF CREATING A HIERARCHY OF ARTIFACTS (FOR BEGINNER, INTERMEDIATE, ADVANCED PRACTITIONERS AND FOR A VARIETY OF LEVELS OF UNDGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS)? 
one that strives to be emancipatory, non-hierarchical, transparent, and advancing social justice. In the service of such praxis, I have gathered here an array of artifacts that range from digital projects to networks of pedagogues to help those who want to practice a digital pedagogy of gender. Each artifact is, or has been, the labor of feminists committed to addressing the historical phallogocentricism and heteronormativity of our disiplines. These artifacts can be used to diversify and complicate existing courses. <—HOW? BE EXPLICIT HERE; YOU’RE CONVINCING THEM TO USE THE MATERIALS Perhaps more importantly, they can be used by teachers who want to examine their own praxis, the text they assign, the courses they design, and work to be cognizant and egalitarian in their gendered practice. <—HOW? 

OVERALL COMMENTS:
FOR new artifacts, if you could follow our naming protocol, that would be very helpful.

Ok, now to the editing stuff:
This is a great start -- and "gender" is hard! Primarily because there are so many focuses for this critical field of study. I could see it pulling your curatorial statement in all directions in order to encapsulate all facets of critical scholarship. But, and this is just a suggestion, you might consider focusing on a few areas that are most important to you and providing a link to a list of recommended readings about scholarship (is there a good bibliography out there that also delineates all the fields?).

It seemed to me that what you would like to highlight is not just gender but the consequences of gender in an online environment AND as a teaching environment (to consider instructor, student identify politics as well as how that's manipulated online to become a strength or a liability). If you want to pursue this area with a cursory overview in the curatorial statement about gender scholarship in gender, please feel free to do so. I think what would really help both you and the potential user of this keyword is to lay out a rationale for choosing the artifacts. Kathi Berens clusters her artifacts into categories. So, too do Gabrielle and Lauren for "archive." And Mark Sample for "play."

There are so many ways to go with gender in a critical engagement. Like Mark, you may have to define it clearly and then say what you're going to discuss and what you won't. But, don't feel pressure to provide an encyclopedic definition of the keyword. (Way too much pressure on you if you took that up!)


## CURATED ARTIFACTS 

###"Chicana Por Mi Raza"
*Artifact Type: public humanities project, digital archive
*Screenshot: images/ChicanaPorMiRaza.png”
*Source URL: http://www.chicanapormiraza.org/
*Artifact Permissions: Anyone may use the archive and ancillary materials so long as they agree to join the Chicana por mi Raza Digital Memory Collective. According to the site, “Members of the collective are granted access to the materials in the collection with the understanding that they will contribute in some way to the goals of the Chicana por mi Raza project.”
*Creator and Affiliation: María Cotera and Linda Garcia Merchant in collaboration with The Institute for Computing in Humanities Arts and Sciences at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign.

Chicana Por Mi Raza is a digital archive of Chicana feminism spanning 1965 to 1985. The collective has recorded over fifty-nine oral histories and gathered roughly 2500 documents, 60 percent of which have been digitized and cataloged. The collection includes a range of materials chronicling Chicana feminist theory and literature, including hours of oral history recordings, publications, notes, correspondences, photographs, and newspaper clippings. The archived materials are organized around important figures, and is also searchable. Additionally, the site makes histories of the Chicano movement more legible through several thematic timelines. This project is of note for its relevance for both K-12 and higher-ed classes to broaden courses in history, feminist and gender studies, literature, and political science. The project’s materials can be used to round out units on 1960s social movements by highlighting discussions of gendered experience in activist movements through access to primary texts by little-known Chicana feminists.
KDH: THIS IS A GREAT COLLECTION, BUT WHAT WOULD STUDENTS DO WITH IT? HOW WILL FACULTY ENGAGE WITH IT? I’M NOT ASKING FOR YOU TO CREATE AN ASSIGNMENT; DOES SOMEONE HAVE ONE OUT THERE? 


###"Digitizing Chinese Englishmen"
*Artifact Type: Digital Archive
*Screenshot: “Digitizing Chinese Englishmen.png”
*Source URL: http://chineseenglishmen.adelinekoh.org/
*Artifact Permissions (note whether content is shared under a Creative Commons license)
*Creator and Affiliation: Adeline Koh (Stockton University)

A project still in its early phases, Digitizing Chinese Englishmen is an ambitious project to digitize and archive the Straits Chinese Magazine, a journal published by diasporic Chinese in Southeast Asia at the turn of the 20th century. The project offers glimpses into colonial Southeast Asia through primary texts. These texts, though limited at the moment, are valuable resources for teaching about gender as it relates to colonialism, imperialism, and race, as the “Victorian Chinesemen” at the heart of the publication present a complex portrait of masculinity and precarious power in Imperial Britain. The decolonial imperative of the project, which is still seeking collaborators, can prove to be important training in praxis for graduate students and advanced undergraduate students in if woven into courses on British Empire or for graduate training in theoretically informed digital projects. Students could gain valuable experience in digitizing, markup, critical annotation and digital project maintenance.
KDH: HERE, TOO, DO YOU HAVE AN EXPLICIT ASSIGNMENT? PERHAPS THIS COULD BE COMBINED WITH ANOTHER ASSIGNMENT THAT’S NOT SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THIS ARCHIVE? KIRSTYN LEUNER HAS SOME WORK ON THIS; PERHAPS SHE HAS AN ASSIGNMENT TO SHARE? 


###"Early Broadside Ballad Archive"
*Artifact Type: Digital archive
*Screenshot: “EBBA.png”
*Source URL: http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu/
*Artifact Permissions: CC BY-NC 4.0
*Creator and Affiliation: The Early Modern Center, Department of English at University of California, Santa Barbara

The most established of the digital archives presented here, the Early Broadside Ballad Project (EBBA) has digitized over 7,000 broadside ballads as textual, visual, and audio artifact. Broadside ballads, a form of 17th century English popular culture ephemera, are significant as cultural texts that reflect the social mores of the day. The archive makes these ballads available as digital facsimiles, modern transcriptions, and recordings. More importantly, for the purposes of this collection, the holdings of the archive are meticulously assigned metadata, tagged, marked up, and made searchable, so teachers can assign and students can perform original research and analysis. In this case, using the Advanced Search function students can perform searches using EBBA’s keywords--which include gender, sex/sexuality, and race--and produce research, close reading or distant reading, focused around gender formation, gender roles, and expectations.
KDH: HERE, TOO, AN ASSIGNMENT TO GO WITH IT? THIS IS A GREAT ARCHIVE FOR THOSE WHO ARE ENGAGED IN TRADITIONAL CANONICAL LITERARY STUDIES COURSES; YOU CAN GAIN SOME NASCENT DIGITAL PEDAGOGY POINTS IF YOU CAN ADD AN ASSIGNMENT TO IT.


###"Fat, Ugly or Slutty"
*Artifact Type: Website, blog
*Screenshot: “Fat Ugly or Slutty.png”
*Source URL: http://fatuglyorslutty.com/
*Artifact Permissions: Copyright Fat, Ugly or Slutty
*Creator and Affiliation: Writers working under pseudonyms

One of the truths of the Internet is that given the chance, people will be trolls. Most often, they will troll to those who do not present as heteronormative, cisgender (white) men. Fat, Ugly or Slutty is a blog that archives the harassment female gamers receive from other (mostly male) gamers, and draws attention to the rampant sexism and rape culture that has become a part of gamer culture. The site itself documents the very gender specific harassment that women gamers tend to receive. The site is an ongoing project (though currently on hiatus as it undergoes some updates) that anyone can submit to, and those submissions are organized according to categories ranging from “Crudely Creative” to “Unprovoked Rage.” As a pedagogical tool, this site gives students an example of a user-created platform for community building, raising awareness, and it offers a store of primary materials for everyday analysis.
KDH: HERE, TOO, BUT ALSO BE EXPLICIT. CHOOSE A CLUSTER OF POSTS INSTEAD OF THE ENTIRE THING. GIVE AN INSTRUCTOR THE TOOLS TO IMMEDIATELY ALLOW STUDENTS TO ENGAGE — AN ASSIGNMENT OR SYLLABUS WOULD BE HELPFUL


###"FemTechNet"
*Artifact Type: Pedagogical network
*Screenshot: “FemTechNet.png”
*Source URL: http://femtechnet.org/
*Artifact Permissions: Creative Commons licensed
*Creator and Affiliation: Distributed network of feminist technologists and teachers

FemTechNet describes itself as “is an activated network of scholars, artists, and students working on, with, and at the borders of technology, science, and feminism in a variety of fields including Science & Technology Studies (STS), Media and Visual Studies, Art, Gender, Queer, and Ethnic Studies.” Working almost entirely virtually, these teachers and scholars have developed a wealth of resources to teach gender, feminism, and technology. The network’s biggest accomplishment includes a Distributed Open Collaborative Course (DOCC), developed as a critique of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Course), that feature a number of Key Learning Projects (from Feminist Mapping to Wiki Storming) that can be woven into any course, and are used to connect nodal DOCC courses. The network also maintains the Critical Race and Ethnic Studies Pedagogy Workbook, a repository of syllabi, learning activities, readings, and videos, to aid in the teaching of race, gender, intersectionality, and technology.
KDH: THIS IS A GREAT RESOURCE, BUT IT CAN BE OVERWHELMING FOR THE NEW OR EXPERIMENTER. WHAT WOULD YOU CHOOSE SPECIFICALLY TO WORK WITH? IS THERE A RANGE THAT YOU CAN RECOMMEND FOR A VARIETY OF LEVELS OF COURSES? 


 
###"Gender Bias on Wikipedia Page"
*Artifact Type: Wiki page
*Screenshot: “Gender bias Wikipedia page.png”

*Artifact Permissions: CC BY-SA 3.0 Unported License
*Creator and Affiliation: Wikimedia and volunteer editors

For several years now, feminist Wikipedians, led initially by Adrianne Wadewitz, have been organizing edit-a-thons to training women, queer communities, and people of color to edit Wikipedia to address gender and racial bias that has resulted in the skewed demographics of Wikipedians, who, according to a survey conducted by the Wikimedia Foundation, are overwhelmingly young, male, and white. As a text for analysis, the “Gender Bias on Wikipedia” page proves a fascinating artifact that documents the controversy in several ways: its published content, the discusses visible on the attendant Talk Page, and in the WikiProjects that are associated with the page. As Wikipedia’s gender based issues seem to prevail, despite the work of volunteers and staff, this page and the related discussions and controversies can be an important text to assign students. Such an activity serves several purposes, least of which is debunking the infallibility of Wikipedia, and training students to critically analyze Wikipedia pages in productive ways.

KDH: THIS ONE, SIMILAR TO THE EBB MENTION, FOCUSES ON ASSESSING GENDERED LANGUAGE AND USE OF INFORMATION TO CRITICALLY ANALYZE THE PRODUCTION OF KNOWLEDGE. IS THERE AN ASSIGNMENT HERE? OR PERHAPS YOU COULD CLUSTER TOGETHER ASSIGNMENTS SUCH AS THIS IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU’D LIKE TO CONVEY VIA GENDER. FOR EXAMPLE, THIS ONE AND THE EBB SEEM TO FOCUS ON REPRESENTATIONS OF GENDER IN WRITING AND THEN IN THE PRODUCTION OF WRITING (WIKIPEDIA). MIGHT THAT BE A CLUSTER OF ASSIGNMENTS THAT COULD BE A GROUPING — AND ALSO HELP YOUR CURATORIAL STATEMENT WITH FOCUS?


###"Regender"

Regender is a web-based tool designed by a computer scientist that performs what the developer calls a “gender hack” on existing websites. Specifically, it highlights the use of gender pronouns in  English-language sites by switching those pronouns. This is a simple, yet great, tool for revealing bias, and for opening up space to unpack gender binaries. Additionally, Regender exposes what Jill Walker Rettberg calls “technological filters” (tools that allow us to change expressions of ourselves) and “cultural filters” (“norms, expectations, normative discursive strategies” that influence our behaviors) that shape our <—KDH: LEAVE OUT FIRST PERSON EVEN HERE; IT ASSUMES THAT THE READER IS ALREADY PART OF THE DISCUSSION SURROUNDING GENDER daily lives online. This serves as an excellent illustration of how code can be used to challenge built-in assumptions of the web and the cultural values expressed in web content. The tool is not perfect and can be buggy, but its flaws (difficulty in determining gender in some cases) also make it good example for discussions of algocentrism.
KDH: THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT; I WOULD SAY HERE TOO THAT IT NEEDS AN ASSIGNMENT OR SOMETHING THAT AN INSTRUCTOR CAN ADOPT IMMEDIATELY. WITH THIS ONE, YOU BRING UP A VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF SEEMINGLY HIDDEN GENDER BIAS — IN CODING. IT’S A GREAT WAY TO GET INSTRUCTORS THINKING ABOUT WHAT’S BEHIND THE CURTAIN, BUT HOW WILL YOU ASK THEM TO INCORPORATE THIS KIND OF ARTIFACT?


 
###“Sociological Images”

The Sociological Images is a section of The Society Pages, an open-access social science project from the Department of Sociology at the University of Minnesota, curated by Lisa Wade (Occidental College). In Sociological Images, Wade shares a collection of resources to help teach and build analytical skills, in particular “sociological imagination.” The materials gathered include a sociological blog; a Pinterest board that curates over 14,500 images from advertisements, pop culture, and other visual culture with blog-length analyses and discussions; course guides; and more. Where the collection excels is in its assemblage of media documenting problematic gendered practices: “pinkwashing”, sexuality in advertisement, and rape culture, among others. Used jointly with the course guides, especially Mary Nell Trautner’s expansive Course Guide for the Sociology of Gender Sociological Images offers a rich resource for teaching about gender and drawing awareness to everyday practice.
KDH: AH HA, MARY NELL’S GUIDE COULD BE THE IN TO THIS GREAT RESOURCE; IF YOU LIST HER WORK AS THE LOCUS FOR THIS PARTICULAR ARTIFACT, YOU GIVE THE INSTRUCTOR SOMETHING CONCRETE TO LOOK AT BEFORE TAKING A DEEPER DIVE INTO THE OTHER RESOURCES. CAN YOU MAKE THE SWITCH FOR THIS ONE?

###“Trans Women and the New Hypertext” 
*Artifact Type: Article

*Artifact Permissions: Copyright Lambda Literary
*Creator and Affiliation: Merrit Kopas, in Lambda Literary

Merritt Kopas, multimedia artist and game designer, writes about independent games with trans narratives. Kopas argues, “hypertext and digital games are totally trans genres”, and she offers a sampling of games produced by trans women who trouble binary gender constructions. The games shared in this article are diverse in subject matter, form, and genre, offering nuanced, first person narratives that interrogating the themes of family, embodiment, love, sex, pleasure and pain. Whether incorporated in literature or gender studies courses, these games broaden the canon of women’s fiction, science fiction, games studies, or electronic literature. In addition, these texts ask students and teachers to engage with texts in a different manner, by immersing themselves in the role of another by making choices that can change the outcome of the narrative. The subtle effects, the excitement or poignancy elicited can be profoundly effective for communicating the trans experience, or complicating the heteronormative one.
KDH: YOU MAY CERTAINLY INCLUDE AN ARTICLE, AND THIS ONE SEEMS IMPORTANT. 


###"The Shoah Foundation Visual History Archive"

*Creator and Affiliation: USC Shoah Foundation

The Shoah Foundation's Visual History Archive (VHA) collects testimonies from survivors of the Holocaust, Rwandan, Nanjing, Cambodian, and Armenian genocides. They currently have 52,000 video testimonies indexed. The database features subtitled videos that are searchable by collection (organized by historical event), language, gender, group, end keyword tags. The archive itself is a rich resource for studying periods of historical genocide, and provides a powerful resource for research in the area of holocaust and genocide. While researchers can perform large-scale quantitative analysis on the huge dataset, the videos lend themselves to in-depth analyses. The specificity of the latter, with emphasis on gender and gendered experiences, can draw stark contrast to historical accounts that flatten human experience with the use of statistics. Instead, using the archive’s search tools, designed to enable this type of research, can add complexity to historical and narrative research of testimonials.
KDH: HERE, TOO, THIS IS TOO LARGE TO MENTION ALL AT ONCE; IS THERE A SPECIFIC EXERCISE OR ASSIGNMENT YOU CAN FOCUS ON INSTEAD?

## CURATORIAL STATEMENT (roughly 750-800 words, MLA Format)

“Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications. Ours is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live.”
-John Perry Barlow, 1996, “A Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace”

 
At its most basic, the term “gender,” based on the mid 20th century work of psychologist John Money, describes the social and enacted sex role, as opposed to biological sex roles as assigned at birth (Halberstam). The Oxford English dictionary traces the etymology of the word to the 12th century Middle French and Anglo-Norman gendre, meaning “kind, sort,” but also “sex, quality of being male or female,” among other things (“Gender”). Money’s use of the term, naturally emphasizes difference, but recognizes the constructed and reinforced nature of that difference. Since then, this conception of gender has been problematized, critiqued, and developed to move beyond gender binaries and include discussions of performativity, racialization, labor, capital, and power.

In the 1990s, the early days of the Internet, many dreamed that we might be able to do away with gender, at least in virtual space. People like John Parry Barlow argued that the new networked communication technologies would allow us to interact without our physical bodies or real-world identities getting in the way. We’d finally be able to get away from our messy, gendered, racialized, fleshy bodies. These digital utopianists have since been proven wrong by the work of scholars of media, writers such as Anne Balsamo, Wendy Chun, Julian Dibbell, Anna Everett, Tara McPherson, Lisa Nakamura, and Sherry Turkle. 

From the TinySex that took place in text-based MUDs and MOOs of the 1990s, to the gendered violence of GamerGate, to the harassment experienced by feminists online (or even any person presenting as female or queerin online spaces), gender has emerged as perhaps the single most important factor in inspiring violence or support and kinship in online spaces. For many, it is the indicator of how we can participate in the civic engagement, how we are treated within the public sphere, and the rights that we are afforded. As part of the “race, gender, sexuality, and class” formula used to categorize populations, and predict or explain their behaviors, gender has proven to be one of the most critical factors in determining our identities, whether virtual or “real.” 

For those of us who teach in both physical classrooms and digital spaces, gender is of paramount importance to that teaching. This refers to both gender and and gendered practice, as these dictate the politics of the classroom community, and power dynamics of the people in the class. It informs what we teach and how we teach with those whom we teach. None of these are neutral.

As Alexis Lothian notes in her curatorial statement of the keyword Sexuality, “Classes in gender and sexuality bring together students for whom the recognition of hard-won identities feels like a matter of life and death, along with those who think that their normative gender and heterosexual identifications mean that a class on sexuality will teach them much about others and little about themselves.” Such a process, though, as Lothian points out, and anyone who has taught gender and sexuality studies can attest, is a difficult and fraught one, and few people ever feel “safe” in such spaces, no matter how hard we as instructors may work to provide such a space. Gender is important as a marker of difference, but also of affinity. In my own classes, whether I am teaching Asian American literature, or digital labor, I purposefully weave gender studies analysis into the study of history, literature, canon formation, or broader interdisciplinary humanities topics. This gives students a more nuanced understanding of specific contexts, of situated knowledge that comes from different experiences, informed by disparate subject positions. At the same time, I ask students to be conscious of their own identities, privileges, expectations, and to question where these come from. 

More broadly, a digital pedagogy attuned to gender must be reflexive of our own genders, our gendered practice, the genders of our students, and the gendering that happens in the classroom. Central to this reflexivity is a sensitivity to the experiential knowledge of each person in the room. Such a pedagogy should also aspire to be a feminist pedagogy, one that strives to be emancipatory, non-hierarchical, transparent, and advancing social justice. In the service of such praxis, I have gathered here an array of artifacts that range from digital projects to networks of pedagogues to help those who want to practice a digital pedagogy of gender. Each artifact is, or has been, the labor of feminists committed to addressing the historical phallogocentricism and heteronormativity of our disiplines. These artifacts can be used to diversify and complicate existing courses. Perhaps more importantly, they can be used by teachers who want to examine their own praxis, the text they assign, the courses they design, and work to be cognizant and egalitarian in their gendered practice. 


## CURATED ARTIFACTS 

### "Chicana Por Mi Raza"
*Artifact Type: public humanities project, digital archive
*Screenshot: “ChicanaPorMiRaza.png”
*Source URL: http://www.chicanapormiraza.org/
*Artifact Permissions: Anyone may use the archive and ancillary materials so long as they agree to join the Chicana por mi Raza Digital Memory Collective. 
According to the site, “Members of the collective are granted access to the materials in the collection with the understanding that they will contribute in some way to the goals of the Chicana por mi Raza project.”
*Creator and Affiliation: María Cotera and Linda Garcia Merchant in collaboration with The Institute for Computing in Humanities Arts and Sciences at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign.

Chicana Por Mi Raza is a digital archive of Chicana feminism spanning 1965 to 1985. The collective has recorded over fifty-nine oral histories and gathered roughly 2500 documents, 60 percent of which have been digitized and cataloged. The collection includes a range of materials chronicling Chicana feminist theory and literature, including hours of oral history recordings, publications, notes, correspondences, photographs, and newspaper clippings. The archived materials are organized around important figures, and is also searchable. Additionally, the site makes histories of the Chicano movement more legible through several thematic timelines. This project is of note for its relevance for both K-12 and higher-ed classes to broaden courses in history, feminist and gender studies, literature, and political science. The project’s materials can be used to round out units on 1960s social movements by highlighting discussions of gendered experience in activist movements through access to primary texts by little-known Chicana feminists.
KDH: THIS IS A FABULOUS ARCHIVE, BUT THINKING ABOUT NEW AND EVEN INTERMEDIATE USERS OF DIGITAL PEDAGOGY, HOW DO THEY USE THIS ARCHIVE? WHAT ASSIGNMENT GOES WITH IT? WHAT WILL STUDENTS *DO* WITH IT? THIS IS WHAT NEEDS TO BE PROVIDED AS AN ARTIFACT. PROVIDING THE ENTIRE DIGITAL ARCHIVE IS OVERWHELMING

### "Digitizing Chinese Englishmen"
*Artifact Type: Digital Archive
*Screenshot: “Digitizing Chinese Englishmen.png”
*Source URL: http://chineseenglishmen.adelinekoh.org/
*Artifact Permissions (note whether content is shared under a Creative Commons license)
*Creator and Affiliation: Adeline Koh (Stockton University)

A project still in its early phases, Digitizing Chinese Englishmen is an ambitious project to digitize and archive the Straits Chinese Magazine, a journal published by diasporic Chinese in Southeast Asia at the turn of the 20th century. The project offers glimpses into colonial Southeast Asia through primary texts. These texts, though limited at the moment, are valuable resources for teaching about gender as it relates to colonialism, imperialism, and race, as the “Victorian Chinesemen” at the heart of the publication present a complex portrait of masculinity and precarious power in Imperial Britain. The decolonial imperative of the project, which is still seeking collaborators, can prove to be important training in praxis for graduate students and advanced undergraduate students in if woven into courses on British Empire or for graduate training in theoretically informed digital projects. Students could gain valuable experience in digitizing, markup, critical annotation and digital project maintenance. <—KDH: GOOD! IS THERE AN ASSIGNMENT THAT SOMEONE CAN ADOPT IMMEDIATELY FOR PERFORMING THIS WORK OR ASSESSING THE ARCHIVE OR ACCOMPANYING ANOTHER ASSIGNMENT OR READING? THAT’S THE STUFF WE NEED, THE ASSIGNMENTS.

### "Early Broadside Ballad Archive"
*Artifact Type: Digital archive
*Screenshot: “EBBA.png”
*Source URL: http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu/
*Artifact Permissions: CC BY-NC 4.0
*Creator and Affiliation: The Early Modern Center, Department of English at University of California, Santa Barbara

The most established of the digital archives presented here, the Early Broadside Ballad Project (EBBA) has digitized over 7,000 broadside ballads as textual, visual, and audio artifact. Broadside ballads, a form of 17th century English popular culture ephemera, are significant as cultural texts that reflect the social mores of the day. The archive makes these ballads available as digital facsimiles, modern transcriptions, and recordings. More importantly, for the purposes of this collection, the holdings of the archive are meticulously assigned metadata, tagged, marked up, and made searchable, so teachers can assign and students can perform original research and analysis. In this case, using the Advanced Search function students can perform searches using EBBA’s keywords--which include gender, sex/sexuality, and race--and produce research, close reading or distant reading, focused around gender formation, gender roles, and expectations.
KDH: SAME COMMENT HERE; WHAT CAN STUDENTS DO WITH THIS? CAN YOU FIND AN ASSIGNMENT THAT USES THE ARCHIVE EXPLICITLY? (WE’RE NOT ASKING YOU TO MAKE UP ASSIGNMENTS BUT INSTEAD SUPPLY WHAT OTHERS HAVE CREATED)


### "Fat, Ugly or Slutty"
*Artifact Type: Website, blog
*Screenshot: “Fat Ugly or Slutty.png”
*Source URL: http://fatuglyorslutty.com/
*Artifact Permissions: Copyright Fat, Ugly or Slutty
*Creator and Affiliation: Writers working under pseudonyms

One of the truths of the Internet is that given the chance, people will be trolls. Most often, they will troll to those who do not present as heteronormative, cisgender (white) men. Fat, Ugly or Slutty is a blog that archives the harassment female gamers receive from other (mostly male) gamers, and draws attention to the rampant sexism and rape culture that has become a part of gamer culture. The site itself documents the very gender specific harassment that women gamers tend to receive. The site is an ongoing project (though currently on hiatus as it undergoes some updates) that anyone can submit to, and those submissions are organized according to categories ranging from “Crudely Creative” to “Unprovoked Rage.” As a pedagogical tool, this site gives students an example of a user-created platform for community building, raising awareness, and it offers a store of primary materials for everyday analysis. <—HOW CAN THIS BE USED IN THE CLASSROOM? WHAT’S THE ASSIGNMENT? MAKE IT MORE THAN CONSCIOUSNESS-RAISING; HOW DOES IT BECOME AWARENESS/ADVOCACY THROUGH PEDAGOGY

### "FemTechNet"
*Artifact Type: Pedagogical network
*Screenshot: “FemTechNet.png”
*Source URL: http://femtechnet.org/
*Artifact Permissions: Creative Commons licensed
*Creator and Affiliation: Distributed network of feminist technologists and teachers

FemTechNet describes itself as “is an activated network of scholars, artists, and students working on, with, and at the borders of technology, science, and feminism in a variety of fields including Science & Technology Studies (STS), Media and Visual Studies, Art, Gender, Queer, and Ethnic Studies.” Working almost entirely virtually, these teachers and scholars have developed a wealth of resources to teach gender, feminism, and technology. The network’s biggest accomplishment includes a Distributed Open Collaborative Course (DOCC), developed as a critique of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Course), that feature a number of Key Learning Projects (from Feminist Mapping to Wiki Storming) that can be woven into any course, and are used to connect nodal DOCC courses. The network also maintains the Critical Race and Ethnic Studies Pedagogy Workbook, a repository of syllabi, learning activities, readings, and videos, to aid in the teaching of race, gender, intersectionality, and technology.
KDH: WITH THIS ONE, CHOOSE 1 THING TO HIGHLIGHT FROM THE ARCHIVE; AN ENTIRE NETWORK IS TOO MUCH FOR A USER TO DIG THROUGH FOR THE PURPOSES OF OUR VOLUME
 
### "Gender Bias on Wikipedia Page"
*Artifact Type: Wiki page
*Screenshot: “Gender bias Wikipedia page.png”
*Source URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_bias_on_Wikipedia
*Artifact Permissions: CC BY-SA 3.0 Unported License
*Creator and Affiliation: Wikimedia and volunteer editors

For several years now, feminist Wikipedians, led initially by Adrianne Wadewitz, have been organizing edit-a-thons to training women, queer communities, and people of color to edit Wikipedia to address gender and racial bias that has resulted in the skewed demographics of Wikipedians, who, according to a survey conducted by the Wikimedia Foundation, are overwhelmingly young, male, and white. As a text for analysis, the “Gender Bias on Wikipedia” page proves a fascinating artifact that documents the controversy in several ways: its published content, the discusses visible on the attendant Talk Page, and in the WikiProjects that are associated with the page. As Wikipedia’s gender based issues seem to prevail, despite the work of volunteers and staff, this page and the related discussions and controversies can be an important text to assign students. Such an activity serves several purposes, least of which is debunking the infallibility of Wikipedia, and training students to critically analyze Wikipedia pages in productive ways.
KDH: AH HA! I’VE SEEN A BUNCH OF WIKIPEDIA EDITING ASSIGNMENTS; YOU CAN DRAW FROM A GENERAL WIKIPEDIA ASSIGNMENT AND SUGGEST TO OUR READERS THAT THEY USE IT TO FOCUS ON GENDER DIFFERENTIATIONS, ETC. DO YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN?

### "Regender"
*Artifact Type: Web tool
*Screenshot “Regender.png”
*Source URL: http://regender.com/
*Artifact Permissions: Copyright Ka-Ping Yee, 2005
*Creator and Affiliation, Ka-Ping Yee

Regender is a web-based tool designed by a computer scientist that performs what the developer calls a “gender hack” on existing websites. Specifically, it highlights the use of gender pronouns in  English-language sites by switching those pronouns. This is a simple, yet great, tool for revealing bias, and for opening up space to unpack gender binaries. Additionally, Regender exposes what Jill Walker Rettberg calls “technological filters” (tools that allow us to change expressions of ourselves) and “cultural filters” (“norms, expectations, normative discursive strategies” that influence our behaviors) that shape our daily lives online. This serves as an excellent illustration of how code can be used to challenge built-in assumptions of the web and the cultural values expressed in web content. The tool is not perfect and can be buggy, but its flaws (difficulty in determining gender in some cases) also make it good example for discussions of algocentrism. <—HERE, TOO, WHAT’S THE ASSIGNMENT?
 
### "Sociological Images"
*Artifact Type: Web page, teaching resources, Pinterest collections
*Screenshot: “Sociological Images.png”
*Source URL: https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/for-instructors/
*Artifact Permissions: CC Attribution Non-Commercial Share Alike
*Creator and Affiliation: Lisa Wade, The Society Pages

The Sociological Images is a section of The Society Pages, an open-access social science project from the Department of Sociology at the University of Minnesota, curated by Lisa Wade (Occidental College). In Sociological Images, Wade shares a collection of resources to help teach and build analytical skills, in particular “sociological imagination.” The materials gathered include a sociological blog; a Pinterest board that curates over 14,500 images from advertisements, pop culture, and other visual culture with blog-length analyses and discussions; course guides; and more. Where the collection excels is in its assemblage of media documenting problematic gendered practices: “pinkwashing”, sexuality in advertisement, and rape culture, among others. Used jointly with the course guides, especially Mary Nell Trautner’s expansive Course Guide for the Sociology of Gender Sociological Images offers a rich resource for teaching about gender and drawing awareness to everyday practice. KDH: SAME COMMENT; PICK 1 THING, 1 ASSIGNMENT AND HIGHLIGHT IT

### "Trans Women and the New Hypertext"
*Artifact Type: Article
*Screenshot: “Lambda Literary - Trans Women and the New Hypertext.png”
*Source URL: http://www.lambdaliterary.org/features/07/08/trans-women-the-new-hypertext/
*Artifact Permissions: Copyright Lambda Literary
*Creator and Affiliation: Merrit Kopas, in Lambda Literary

Merritt Kopas, multimedia artist and game designer, writes about independent games with trans narratives. Kopas argues, “hypertext and digital games are totally trans genres”, and she offers a sampling of games produced by trans women who trouble binary gender constructions. The games shared in this article are diverse in subject matter, form, and genre, offering nuanced, first person narratives that interrogating the themes of family, embodiment, love, sex, pleasure and pain. Whether incorporated in literature or gender studies courses, these games broaden the canon of women’s fiction, science fiction, games studies, or electronic literature. In addition, these texts ask students and teachers engage with texts in a different manner, by immersing themselves in the role of another by making choices that can change the outcome of the narrative. The subtle effects, the excitement or poignancy elicited can be profoundly effective for communicating the trans experience, or complicating the heteronormative one. KDH: SO IN THE CURATORIAL STATEMENT, YOU MIGHT CREATE A RATIONALE FOR WHY YOU’VE SELECTED THESE PARTICULAR ARTIFACTS; FOR INSTANCE, THIS READING COULD STAY IN YOUR ARTIFACT LIST, BUT HIGHLIGHT WHY IT’S NECESSARY AND WHAT IT GENERATES FOR STUDENTS TO READ THROUGH THIS; MIGHT IT GO WITH A GAME-BUILDING ASSIGNMENT? OR, YOU MIGHT CONSIDER SHIFTING THIS TO YOUR 5 ADDITIONAL RESOURCES?

### "The Shoah Foundation Visual History Archive"
*Artifact Type: Digital archive

*Creator and Affiliation: USC Shoah Foundation

The Shoah Foundation's Visual History Archive (VHA) collects testimonies from survivors of the Holocaust, Rwandan, Nanjing, Cambodian, and Armenian genocides. They currently have 52,000 video testimonies indexed. The database features subtitled videos that are searchable by collection (organized by historical event), language, gender, group, end keyword tags. The archive itself is a rich resource for studying periods of historical genocide, and provides a powerful resource for research in the area of holocaust and genocide. While researchers can perform large-scale quantitative analysis on the huge dataset, the videos lend themselves to in-depth analyses. The specificity of the latter, with emphasis on gender and gendered experiences, can draw stark contrast to historical accounts that flatten human experience with the use of statistics. Instead, using the archive’s search tools, designed to enable this type of research, can add complexity to historical and narrative research of testimonials. <—KDH: SAME COMMENT HERE, TOO; WHAT’S THE ASSIGNMENT?
