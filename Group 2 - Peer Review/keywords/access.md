## CURATORIAL STATEMENT

In relation to digital pedagogy, what do we <—LIMIT USE OF FIRST PERSON UNLESS IT’S DISCUSSING AN ESSENTIAL CLASSROOM EXPERIENCE talk about when we talk about "access"? What does it mean to say something is "accessible" or to discuss the importance of "accessibility"? This is actually not a simple question to answer. <—I THINK THESE ARE THOUGHTFUL QUESTIONS, BUT THEY SEEM MORE LIKE PLACE HOLDERS TO GET INTO THE CRITICAL DISCOURSE ABOUT THE TERM IN THE FOLLOWING SENTENCES. CAN YOU CUT THESE FIRST SENTENCES? The concept of "access" has long had an association with privilege or power: to gain access is to be able to enter into a space where others might be denied admittance. <—IS THERE SOME SCHOLARSHIP ON THIS? OR SOMETHING YOU CAN CITE? In the context of education, however, there are additional layers of meaning. <—HERE IS WHERE YOU CAN DEFINE YOUR IDEAS BEHIND ACCESS AND IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO DO THIS BEFORE YOU GET INTO PEDAGOGY 

For example, by focusing our <—CUT USES OF PLURAL FIRST PERSON attention on the digital part of digital pedagogy, we observe that the Internet is home to a passionate "open access" community dedicated to advocating for the widespread and free availability of information, so one meaning has to do with whether or not a user can easily read or otherwise make use of a particular resource. <—SO, FOR THIS VERY BRIEF CURATORIAL STATEMENT, IT’S NOT TO TRY TO DEFINE ALL THE MEANINGS OF ACCESS; INSTEAD, JUMP RIGHT INTO YOUR PRESCRIPTION OF IT ACCORDING TO RELEVANT WRITINGS If instead we focus our attention on the pedagogical part of digital pedagogy, then we notice that "accessible" carries with it the connotation of being understandable to a particular (often beginner-level) audience, so an additional meaning involves whether or not a user can cognitively process the information provided by a particular resource. <—FOR THE OPENING OF THIS CURATORIAL STATEMENT, IT SEEMS LIKE YOU ARE STRUGGLING TO DEFINE ACCESS AND GRAPPLE WITH THE TERMS ACCESS, ACCESSIBILITY THAT BECOME CONFLATED BETWEEN ADA COMPLIANCE OR FREELY AVAILABLE MATERIALS. THINK ABOUT THIS STATEMENT AS AN INTRODUCTION TO THE IDEAS BEHIND ACCESS IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU’D LIKE TO CONVEY. FOR ME, THE NEXT PARAGRAPH IS REALLY THE CRUX OF YOUR CURATORIAL STATEMENT; IT SEEMS THAT YOU CAN DELETE THE PREVIOUS TWO PARAGRAPHS AND START FROM THIS NEXT PARAGRAPH TO DISCUSS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DISABILITY, ACCESSIBILITY, OPEN ACCESS, AND ACCESSIBLE. IF IT HELPS, THINK ABOUT THE READER AS A NEWBIE NOT JUST TO DIGITAL PEDAGOGY BUT ALSO TO THE IDEAS BEHIND ACCESS. DO YOU WANT TO NORM THEM IN TERMS OF THE COMPLICATIONS OF THE TERM ACCESS OR DO YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THE RELATIONSHIP AMONG ALL OF THE PARADIGMS THAT YOU NAME BELOW (I GATHER IT’S THE LATTER) 

Finally, if we <—NO FIRST PERSON HERE NECESSARY consider the needs of people with disabilities using digital resources, then we might realize <—IS IMPORTANT FOR A FACULTY MEMBER TO REALIZE THIS? PERHAPS ADJUST A BIAS? that "accessibility" is bound up with the meanings associated with "open access" and "accessible." In this context, accessibility exists when a user (who may or may not have a particular disability) can easily make use of a particular digital resource  (which may be textual, auditory, visual, or some combination) with their choice of technology (which may or may not be explicitly labeled "assistive" technology) and can, as a result, cognitively process the information as it comes to them from that resource through that technology.<—THIS IS GREAT, IF ONLY FOR THE FACT THAT ALL OF YOUR PARENTHETICAL STATEMENTS ARTICULATE ALL OF THE DIFFERENCE AND CONFUSION ABOUT THESE TERMS AND THEIR PRACTICE USES. DO YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN THIS FURTHER?
 This last meaning as described here might not be as straightforward as the others, but I've <—IS FIRST PERSON NECESSARY HERE? phrased things in this manner to illustrate that concerns about making a resource "open access" or "accessible" as defined above are inextricable from concerns about "accessibility." This keyword entry focuses on access from the perspective of making digital resources usable by people with disabilities with the understanding that doing the work necessary to achieve this kind of accessibility goes a long way towards the goals associated with the other meanings of access.<—AH HA!! THIS IS IT! I THINK, REALLY, YOUR IDEAS START HERE. 

From a digital pedagogy perspective, <—I’M NOT SURE THIS IS NECESSARY TO SAY; REMEMBER, YOU HAVE USERS/READERS COMING TO THIS COLLECTION WHO ARE NEW AT DIGITAL PEDAGOGY OR MAY NOT KNOW WHAT IT MEANS 
the importance of access has intensified in recent years as a result of a number of different factors. The growth in using information and communication technologies for teaching and learning has led to more and more users accessing educational materials primarily through digital means, both for courses that meet face-to-face and those that are solely offered online. The high cost of commercially-produced textbooks and associated media has fueled a movement of producing and using open educational resources available online. The enforcement (however inconsistent) of legal requirements concerning accessibility in educational environments has offered a significant incentive to institutions who might otherwise be reluctant to devote adequate attention to the issue. Finally, the development and extensive adoption of the universal design for learning (UDL) framework has led many educators to consider the ways access (or its lack) affects the diverse kinds of students found in the classroom. All of these factors have combined to make this a particularly important keyword at this time. <—I DON’T THINK YOU NEED THIS LAST SENTENCE; THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT YOU’RE DISCUSSING COMES THROUGH IN THE ENTIRE PARAGRAPH

With regard to digital pedagogy, <—HMM, LET’S CUT THIS PHRASE keeping access in mind can take different forms. <—AND WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT TO NOTE? For example, access should be part of the criteria used when choosing materials assigned to be read (or viewed or listened to). And any instructional materials generated for class &mdash; e.g. syllabi, assignment sheets, video tutorials, course websites &mdash; should be created while following current accessibility guidelines. Finally, students who create digital products for class should be provided with the opportunity to learn the importance of access and given the tools for evaluating and improving the accessibility of the materials they produce; this may be done in any course at any level, so long as the appropriate adjustments are made for the specific context.

KDH: HERE IS A MOMENT AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE CURATORIAL STATEMENT WHERE YOU CAN ADD SPECIFIC CATEGORIES OR RATIONALE FOR THE SELECTION OF MATERIALS. FOR INSTANCE, TAKE A LOOK AT MARK’S USE OF VARIANT DEFINITIONS IN THE KEYWORD, PLAY, OR KATHI BERENS’ USER-LEVEL EXPERIENCE IN ORGANIZING THE ARTIFACTS (BEGINNER, INTERMEDIATE, ADVANCED) IN INTERFACE OR THE CATEGORIZATION GABRIELLE AND LAUREN USE IN ARCHIVE. YOU’RE WELCOME TO DO THAT IF IT HELPS YOU ORGANIZE YOUR IDEAS AROUND ACCESS.

I CAN SEE A FEW CATEGORIES EMERGING FROM THE PREVIOUS 2 PARAGRAPHS AND OFFERS MORE THAN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH IN TERMS OF CURATING.

I have assumed that those concerned with "access" will approach this term through a variety of avenues. As a result of this assumption, the material selected here &mdash; presented in alphabetical order &mdash; ranges from exhaustive guides to fulfilling technical standards for digital accessibility to discussions of the complexity of access in pedagogy to specific assignments others have used in their courses.

KDH: MY COMMENTS ABOUT EACH ARTIFACT ARE BELOW THAT PARTICULAR ARTIFACT

## CURATED ARTIFACTS

### Accessibility Audit Assignment

This assignment asks students to evaluate the accessibility of a given physical space on campus using a checklist that is composed in part of specific legal requirements and design recommendations and in part of suggestions and concerns created by students in the class. In this way, students are encouraged to think about accessibility in a holistic way and not just as a simple list of conditions that must be met. The digital aspect of the activity as described here is that students are encouraged to photograph the space they're evaluating. However, an instructor could easily incorporate additional technologies &mdash; such as audio and video &mdash; into the required final product. An especially ambitious adaptation of the assignment could require a redesign of the space using 3D digital modeling tools.

KDH: THIS IS A GREAT ASSIGNMENT; AND I’VE NEVER HEARD OF IT. SO FASCINATING.

OVERALL COMMENT: I REALLY SEE CATEGORIES HERE WITH ALL OF THESE GREAT ARTIFACTS. SOME CHALLENGE STUDENTS TO THINK ABOUT ALTERNATIVES FORMS OF CRITICAL THINKING WHILE PERFORMING ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF CRITICAL THINKING. IN OTHER WORDS: CONSTRUCT A VISUAL ANALYSIS THAT THEN OFFERS A SECONDARY ANALYSIS BASED ON CREATING, FOR EXAMPLE, ALT TEXT FOR IMAGES. SO STUDENTS ARE WORKING THROUGH 2 LEVELS OF CRITICAL THINKING. THE OTHER IS ASKING STUDENTS TO EVALUATE WORK THAT HAS BEEN PRODUCED BY ANOTHER SOURCE (AS OPPOSED TO HAVING THEM CREATE SOMETHING).  ANOTHER CATEGORY IS SPECIFICALLY FOR THE FACULTY — WHAT THEY NEED TO DO EVEN BEFORE THEY START INVOLVING STUDENTS IN EVALUATING AND CREATING.

### Accessibility Report Assignment

Given to students in a graduate-level class on "Web Accessibility and Disability Studies,"  this assignment clearly explains how to evaluate a website's accessibility and points out that "[c]hecking for accessibility involves a combination of software tools and human judgment." Zdenek recommends specific techniques to try and provides a detailed list of software tools that automate much of the process. A particular strength here is the balance between technical standards for access and the necessity of understanding and explaining accessibility recommendations persuasively. Although this assignment might be too advanced for some undergraduate courses, it could easily be adapted. For example, accessibility evaluation could be an important part of a peer review workshop where students provide each other feedback on their own digital projects. 

KDH: GREAT EXPLANATION OF USE AND LEVELS OF ENGAGEMENT WITH THIS ASSIGNMENT

### Audio/Visual Description Assignment

Many courses that once might have asked students to author text-only assignments now require them to create artifacts with a significant visual component, artifacts ranging from infographics to comics to digital stories. Potential readers of those artifacts who are blind or have low vision will, of course, find them more than a little challenging. In her course on multimedia composition &mdash; as part of her unit on "Thinking in Pictures" &mdash; Vidali has her students create a comic and then introduces them to the concept of "visual/audio description." She explains why multiple means of representation are important, distinguishes between interpretation and description, and provides several links to explanations and examples from various sources. This assignment requires students to publish their text-based description alongside their comic.

KDH: AGAIN, GREAT ASSIGNMENT

### Composing Access

This website provides extensive advice and specific guidelines for how to "enhance accessibility at [academic] conferences," but most of what can be found here is useful information for the classroom, either for instructors wishing to improve the accessibility of their teaching methods or for students who have been assigned a presentation for class. The information here is not presented dogmatically; instead, the authors write, "[w]e encourage you to shop around, pick up ideas as you like, and hopefully try something new." The section titled "Preparing Your Presentation" covers such topics as the physical space of the presentation, designing useful handouts, sharing presentation material online, and preparing a script to be shared with others such as sign-language interpreters and audience members who might have difficulty processing auditory information. There is also a section explaining what to do "During the Presentation" and a page with links to additional information.

KDH: THIS SET OF GUIDELINES SEEMS LIKE IT SHOULD COME FIRST IN THE LIST OF ARTIFACTS — IT SETS THE TONE FOR HELPING INSTRUCTORS AS WELL AS HELPING THEM TO HELP STUDENTS.

### Suggested Practices for Syllabus Accessibility Statements
![screenshot](access-praxis-wiki-suggested-practices-for-syllabus-accessibility-statements.png)

* Artifact Type: Article

This straightforward and well-organized essay discusses an important element of the syllabus that many instructors might be tempted to overlook: the statement of accessibility (often referred to by other terms, such as "Disability Statement" or "Accommodations Statement"). Institutions often provide boilerplate language to be copied and pasted into syllabi, language that is chosen not with pedagogy in mind but with the aim of legal compliance. Wood and Madden emphasize the rhetorical significance of the statement and encourage instructors to create their own, arguing that it "warrants closer attention from [those] who wish to create inclusive classrooms and meet their students' needs in flexible and comprehensive ways." They offer practical advice not only for how to word the statement of accessibility but also how to re-think pedagogy to take into account the needs of diverse students. Examples are provided from others, and further reading is recommended.

KDH: THIS ARTIFACT, TOO, IS GEARED TOWARDS FACULTY AND COULD BE CATEGORIZED EARLIER IN THE SELECTIONS SO INSTRUCTORS SEE IT FIRST BEFORE CONSTRUCTING OR ADOPTING THESE OTHER ASSIGNMENTS.

### UDL on Campus: Universal Design for Learning in Higher Education

The UDL on Campus website is an exhaustive resource addressing universal design for learning at colleges and universities. The site provides information about and examples of [UDL initiatives in higher education](http://udloncampus.cast.org/page/udl_landing), guidance on [course design](http://udloncampus.cast.org/page/planning_landing), advice on [working with digital media](http://udloncampus.cast.org/page/media_landing), and a discussion of the [legal ramifications](http://udloncampus.cast.org/page/policy_landing) of accessibility and equal access for all students. The section on digital media might be of most obvious use to instructors, who can use that information to guide their own media creation practice but perhaps also to guide students in their completion of digital assignments. However, the issues addressed in the other sections encourage thoughtful consideration of how individual classroom practice fits into the larger picture of accessibility and UDL on college and university campuses.

KDH: THIS TOO SEEMS LIKE IT CAN BE UP FRONT WITH THE PREVIOUS 2. HOWEVER, THIS MIGHT BE TOO BIG OF A RESOURCE. PERHAPS THIS COULD BE SHIFTED TO THE 5 ADDITIONAL RESOURCES UNLESS THERE’S SOMETHING SPECIFIC YOU CAN FOCUS ON.

### Universal Design: Places to Start

Dolmage summarizes the traditional definition of universal design for learning (UDL) "as the use of multiple and flexible strategies to address the needs of all students" that is often reduced to a finite checklist of specific tasks that seldom requires a significant re-conception of how we go about the work of teaching and learning. This checklist approach has the unfortunate effect of implying that once all of the items on the list have been completed, any thought about why and how best to apply UDL principles will stop. Dolmage invites us to start thinking instead about UDL as an ongoing practice, one that requires us to consider the access needs of every given situation as unique. A crowd-sourced appendix is provided containing an extensive list of UDL strategies "organized according to some of the different modes of 'delivery' or styles of teaching in higher education."

KDH: HERE TOO, I SEE THIS MORE AS AN ADDITIONAL RESOURCE RATHER THAN A PEDAGOGICAL RESOURCE THAT SOMEONE CAN ADOPT RIGHT NOW. 

### WebAIM Articles

Utah State University’s Center for Persons with Disabilities is home to WebAIM (Web Accessibility in Mind), a non-profit organization whose mission is to improve the accessibility of the web through a variety of educational strategies. This page of WebAIM articles provides an in-depth but beginner-friendly set of readings on a wide range of topics, organized under such headings as "User’s Perspective," "HTML Accessibility," and "Evaluation, Testing, and Tools." Although this page features explanations of technical standards and tutorials on how to meet them, it also provide valuable information on legal requirements, strategies for implementing accessibility policies, and how different disabilities can affect users’ experience of digital environments.  These articles would be very useful to an instructor working to ensure her course materials are accessible and would also make appropriate assigned readings in a course where students create digital resources.

KDH: HERE TOO, I SEE THIS MORE AS AN ADDITIONAL RESOURCE RATHER THAN A PEDAGOGICAL RESOURCE THAT SOMEONE CAN ADOPT RIGHT NOW. 

### WordPress Accessibility Handbook

The content-management system and blogging tool WordPress has been widely adopted as a platform for teaching and learning in higher education, used to host the content for entire courses and to give students a medium to publish their work for class. The WordPress Accessibility Team has been working for the last few years to make accessibility a core feature of the software by making specific recommendations, [developing plugins](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/testing-and-development-tools/wp-accessibility-plugin/), and [evaluating themes](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/). The in-progress *Accessibility Handbook* offers guidance and advice for WordPress users ranging from developers to designers to those who just want an easy-to-use online home for their content. The information found here could be used productively by an instructor building a site for a course or assigned as required reading for students developing their own sites for  a class project.

KDH: DO YOU KNOW IF SOMEONE HAS USED THIS FOR A CLASS PROJECT OR ASSIGNMENT? COULD YOU FIND ONE? (NOT ASKING YOU TO CREATE ONE). I ASK BECAUSE HERE, TOO, THIS MIGHT BE BETTER PLACED IN THE 5 ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. IT’S SOMETHING AN INSTRUCTOR NEEDS TO READ THROUGH BUT WHAT DO THEY DO WITH IT (SOLELY FOR PREP OR CAN IT BE ARTICULATED IN THE CURRICULUM IN SOME WAY?)

### YouDescribe: Testing Crowd-sourced Video Description for Service Learning at the City University of New York

Although as a video-sharing website YouTube is a primarily visual medium of information, the site is visited by a significant number of users who are blind or have low vision. For such users, the availability of video descriptions &mdash; an audio track where someone narrates the information that is only presented visually &mdash; makes a particular video much more accessible. Rodas reviews and reflects on YouDescribe, a free tool for crowdsourcing video descriptions of YouTube videos, noting that she was surprised to find herself less confident with the task of description than with the need to learn the tool’s interface. She concludes that an assignment requiring students to use YouDescribe might be discouraging to first-year students just being introduced to multimedia composition assignments but would be effective in a class of more-advanced and tech-confident students.

KDH: INTERESTING ARTIFACT; IT’S A GOOD START TO AN ASSIGNMENT FOR SOMEONE TO TAKE UP POTENTIALLY
